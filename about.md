Hi there!  My name is Austin Paik, and I am a recent alumni from the University of Southern California.  
I created this website to combine my hobbies of photography and web development.
While at USC, I was a photographer for the Daily Trojan newspaper.
I have taught myself coding through online resources such as Harvard's CS50 course.
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at [austindpaik@gmail.com][mailto:austindpaik@gmail.com]!
