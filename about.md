Hi there! My name is Austin Paik. I am a former student at the University of Southern California and now live and work in Madison, WI. I created this website to combine my hobbies of photography and coding. While at USC, I was a photographer for the Daily Trojan newspaper. I  taught myself coding through online resources like Harvard's CS50 course. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at austindpaik@gmail.com!
